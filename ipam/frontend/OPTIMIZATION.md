# IPAM Frontend Optimization

This document outlines the optimizations implemented in the IPAM frontend application to improve performance, maintainability, and user experience.

## Phase 1: Centralized Hooks Implementation

### API Hooks

We've implemented a set of centralized API hooks to standardize data fetching and mutation operations:

- `useBaseQuery`: Core hook for data fetching with standardized error handling and response transformation
- `useBaseMutation`: Core hook for data mutations (create, update, delete) with proper query invalidation
- `useTableData`: Specialized hook for table data with pagination, search, and filtering
- `useReferenceData`: Hook for efficiently fetching and managing reference data across components
- `useVRFData`: Specialized hook for VRF-related operations
- `usePrefixData`: Specialized hook for prefix data with hierarchy support

### Form Hooks

We've created reusable form hooks to standardize form handling:

- `useFormState`: Core hook for form state management, validation, and submission
- `useIPAMForm`: Specialized hook for IPAM form handling with schema-based validation

### Error Handling

- Added a reusable ErrorBoundary component to catch and handle errors in React components
- Implemented standardized error handling in API hooks

## Phase 2: Code Splitting with Lazy Loading

Implemented code splitting with React's lazy loading to improve initial load time:

- Main route components are now loaded lazily
- Added a loading fallback component
- Created proper component exports to work with lazy loading

## Phase 3: Code Cleanup

Removed redundant code and organized utilities for better maintainability:

- Removed component-specific hooks that were replaced by centralized hooks
  - Deleted old hooks in `IPAMTable/hooks.ts`
  - Deleted old hooks in `IPAMModal/hooks/` directory
- Centralized utility functions
  - Moved validation utilities to `src/utils/validation/`
  - Created a proper index file for importing validation utilities
- Removed unused files and dead code
  - Removed barrel files and other unused utilities
  - Standardized imports across components

## Benefits

These optimizations provide the following benefits:

1. **Improved Code Organization**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Centralized logic in reusable hooks
   - Better code maintainability

2. **Reduced Duplication**
   - Common patterns are now implemented once in shared hooks
   - Standardized error handling
   - Consistent form validation

3. **Better Performance**
   - Lazy loading reduces initial bundle size
   - Optimized data fetching with proper caching
   - Reduced unnecessary re-renders

4. **Enhanced Developer Experience**
   - Simplified component implementations
   - More predictable state management
   - Better error handling
   - Improved code structure and organization

## Future Optimizations

Potential next steps for further optimization:

1. **Memoization**
   - Apply React.memo to more components
   - Use useMemo and useCallback more extensively for expensive operations
   - Optimize list rendering with virtualization

2. **State Management**
   - Consider implementing a more robust global state management solution
   - Optimize context usage to prevent unnecessary re-renders

3. **Bundle Optimization**
   - Further code splitting based on usage patterns
   - Analyze and reduce dependencies where possible
   - Implement progressive loading strategies
