# Mantine React Table Migration

This document outlines the migration process from the original custom table implementation to Mantine React Table (MRT).

## Overview

The IPAM application has been fully migrated from a custom table implementation to use [Mantine React Table](https://mantine-react-table.com/), a feature-rich table library built on top of Mantine UI.

## Migration Strategy

To ensure a smooth transition, we implemented the following strategy:

1. Created a new implementation (`IPAMTableMRT.tsx`) that uses the Mantine React Table library
2. Maintained the same API and props structure as the original implementation
3. Created a compatibility wrapper to ensure existing views continue to work without code changes
4. Migrated a subset of routes for testing before rolling out the full migration
5. Updated the SharedTableComponent to use the MRT implementation
6. Added enhanced styling with `mrt-fixes.css` for consistent appearance

## Migration Status

- ✅ All direct usages of IPAMTable now use the MRT implementation
- ✅ All views using SharedTableComponent now use the MRT implementation 
- ✅ All test routes have been updated
- ✅ Styling has been improved for better text visibility and consistency

## Benefits of Mantine React Table

- Built-in support for advanced features:
  - Pagination
  - Sorting
  - Filtering
  - Column resizing
  - Column reordering
  - Row selection
  - Data exporting
- Better performance for large datasets
- Consistent UI with the Mantine design system
- Active maintenance and community support
- Enhanced styling with better text visibility

## Implementation Details

The new implementation is located in:
- `components/IPAMTable/IPAMTableMRT.tsx` - Main implementation
- `components/tables/IPAMTable.tsx` - Compatibility wrapper
- `components/tables/SharedTableComponent.tsx` - Additional wrapper for shared view components
- `components/IPAMTable/mrt-fixes.css` - CSS fixes for styling issues

The wrapper ensures that existing views continue to work without requiring code changes.

## Styling Improvements

Several styling improvements have been made:
- Better text visibility for all cells
- Consistent column widths based on data type
- Improved status badges with better visibility
- Monospace fonts for network addresses and technical data
- Enhanced action buttons
- Fixed text overflow issues

For more details, see the [Styling Documentation](../IPAMTable/STYLING.md).

## How to Use

Existing code will continue to work through the compatibility wrapper. To explicitly use the new implementation:

```tsx
import IPAMTableMRT from '../IPAMTable/IPAMTableMRT';

function MyView() {
  return (
    <IPAMTableMRT
      tableName="prefixes"
      customActionsRenderer={(item) => (
        // Custom actions
      )}
    />
  );
}
```

## Custom Features

The MRT implementation includes all the custom features from the original implementation:
- Status badges
- Utilization bars for prefixes
- Reference value resolution
- Custom action buttons
- Special formatting for different data types
- CSV export functionality

## Future Enhancements

With the migration to MRT completed, we can more easily add the following features in the future:
- Column visibility toggle
- Advanced data export options (Excel, PDF, etc.)
- Row grouping
- Advanced filtering
- State persistence
- Customizable density options
- Responsive layouts for mobile devices
